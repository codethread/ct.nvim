# clojure spec

[Why spec](https://clojure.org/about/spec)
[Docs](https://clojure.org/guides/spec)

spec is amazing, to paraphrase the 'why spec' docs, along with my thoughts on how this pairs with neovim

> Docs are not enough

> We routinely deal with optional and partial data, data produced by unreliable external sources, dynamic queries etc.

> Manual parsing and error reporting is not good enough

> in all languages, dynamic or not, tests are essential to quality. Too many critical properties are not captured by common type systems. But manual testing has a very low effectiveness/effort ratio. Property-based, generative testing, as implemented for Clojure in test.check, has proved to be far more powerful than manually written tests.

## Example in clojure

```clj
; here we have a function that takes in two args, and labels them a and b, it then adds them and returns the result
(defn add-bigger [a b] (+ a b))

; now we 'def'ine some specs using things in the spec namespace, aliased here to `s`.
(s/def ::positive (s/and int? #(> % 0)))

;; if you don't know clojure or spec, here it is again with some explanation
(s/def ::positive ; first comes the label (which is clj is a globally unique thanks to namespaces), this will be put in the global registry
		(s/and ; this spec will have multiple conditions
			int? ; the value must be an integer, `int?` is a spec builtin
			#(> % 0))) ; shorthand anonymous function where `%` is a placeholder for the argument
						; fully expanded would be (def anonymous_1 [x] (> x 0))

; now we can check if something is valid
(s/valid? ::positive 1) ; => true
(s/valid? ::positive 1.0) ; => false
(s/valid? ::positive -2) ; => false


; specs can be applied to a function (which was already defined)
; here we define specs for the args, return value, and an fn to run against the returned value.
; fn is basically a unit test written inline
(s/fdef add-bigger
; here we are saying start and end must be ::positive, which will use our spec from earlier
; start must be bigger than end
  :args (s/and (s/cat :start ::positive :end ::positive)
         #(> (:start %) (:end %)))
  :ret ::positive
  :fn #(=
       	(+ (-> % :args :start) (-> % :args :end))
       	(:ret %)))

(add-bigger 10 5) ;=> 15
(add-bigger 5 10) ;=> 15 WAIT! that should have failed our spec!

; by default specs are off, so we have to turn them on
(stest/instrument `add-bigger)
(add-bigger 5 10) ;=> :failure - and some info about the failure
```
